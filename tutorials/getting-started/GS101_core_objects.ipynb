    "# Understanding the Core Objects in Deeplay\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting to implement applications in Deeplay, let's define the most important objects for building a model in Deeplay:\n",
    "- **Application:** The main object that defines the neural network architecture and training process. This includes the loss, the optimizer, and the training logic. They are typically task-oriented, such as `ImageClassifier`, `ObjectDetector`.\n",
    "- **Model:** A model is a specific neural network architecture that is part of an application. Examples include `ResNet`, `VGG`.\n",
    "- **Component:** A model is usually made by combining multiple components. Components are much more flexible than models. Examples include `MultiLayerPerceptron`, `ConvolutionalEncoder2d`.\n",
    "- **Block:** A block is a specific combination of layers that performs a small unit of calculation (for example `layer->activation`). Blocks are the building blocks of components, and are the most flexible objects in Deeplay. Examples include `LinearBlock`, `Conv2dBlock`.\n",
    "- **Layer:** A layer consists of a single torch layer, such as `torch.nn.Linear`, `torch.nn.Conv2d`. Layers are the most basic building blocks in Deeplay.\n",
