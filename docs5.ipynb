    "### Root level files\n",
    "\n",
    "The project contains the following files at the root level:\n",
    "- `LICENSE.txt`: The license file for the project\n",
    "- `.pylintrc`: The configuration file for the pylint tool. It contains the rules for code formatting and style, especially the warning to be ignored.\n",
    "- `README.md`: The project's README file\n",
    "- `requirements.txt`: The file containing the dependencies for the project\n",
    "- `setup.cfg`: The configuration file for the setup tool. It contains the metadata for the project.\n",
    "- `setup.py`: The setup file for the project. It contains the instructions for installing the project.\n",
    "- `stylestubgen.py`: The script for generating the style stubs for the project. These are type hints for the style system. It creates .pyi files for select classes in the project, and adds overrides to the `style` method to enforce the type hints. It also handles the doc strings for the styles in the same way.\n",

    "The project contains the following directories at the root level:\n",
    "- `.github`: Contains the GitHub actions workflow files for the project. These run the continuous integration tests for the project.\n",
    "- `.vscode`: Contains the Visual Studio Code settings for the project. These settings are used to configure the editor for the project. They include good defaults for the editor, such as the code formatter and the linter.\n",
    "- `deeplay`: Contains the source code for the project. This is where the main code for the project is located.\n",
    "- `guidelines`: Contains the guidelines for contributing to the project. These are the instructions for developers who want to contribute to the project, and should be followed when making changes to the project.\n",
    "- `tutorials`: Contains the tutorial files for the project. These are jupyter notebooks that provide a comprehensive guide to the Deeplay library, focused on helping users and developers get started with, and make the most of the library."

    "\n",
    "The deeplay source code is organized in a hierarchical structure. The main focus is ensuring that files only depend on other files in the same or lower (closer to the root) directories. This is to prevent circular dependencies and make the codebase easier to understand. So, for example in the structure:\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "a_folder/\n",
    "    __init__.py\n",
    "    a.py\n",
    "    b_folder/\n",
    "        __init__.py\n",
    "        b.py\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    c_folder/\n",
    "        __init__.py\n",
    "        c.py\n",
    "        c_extra.py\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`a.py` can import `b.py` and `c.py`, but `b.py` and `c.py` cannot import `a.py`. Moreover, `b.py` should not import `c.py` or `c_extra.py`. But `c.py` can import `c_extra.py` and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",

If a file exports multiple classes or functions, they should be related to each other and should be used together. If a file exports multiple unrelated classes or functions, it should be split into multiple files. It is better to organize the codebase such that related objects are in the same folder instead of the same file."

    "This directory contains the classes and functions related to applications in the Deeplay library. Applications are classes that contain the training logic for specific tasks, such as classification, regression, segmentation, etc. They handle all the details of training a model for a specific task, except for the model architecture.\n",

    "### `components`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### `external`\n",

    "\n",
    "### `ops`\n",
    "\n",
    "Contains individual operations that are used in the blocks and components. These are generally low-level, non-trainable operations, such as `Reshape`, `Cat`, etc. They act like individual layers.\n",

    "[black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). We are not close to lint-compliance yet, but we are working on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use type hints extensively to make the code more readable and maintainable. The type hints should be as specific as possible.\n",
    "For example, if a string can be one of several values, use a `Literal` type hint. Similarly, if a function takes a list of integers,\n",
    "the type hint should be `List[int]` instead of `List`. We are currently supporting Python 3.8 and above. Some features of Python 3.9\n",
    "are not supported yet, such as the `|` operator for type hints. You can get around this by importing `annotations` from `__future__`.\n",

    "### Naming conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond what is defined in the PEP 8 guidelines, we have the following naming conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Minimize the use of abbreviations. If an abbreviation is used, it should be well-known and not ambiguous.\n",
    "- Use the following names:\n",
    "  - \"layer\" for a class that represents a single layer in a neural network, typically the learnable part of a block.\n",
    "  - \"activation\" for a class that represents a non-learnable activation function.\n",
    "  - \"normalization\" for a class that represents a normalization layer.\n",
    "  - \"dropout\" for a class that represents a dropout layer.\n",
    "  - \"pool\" for a class that represents a pooling layer.\n",
    "  - \"block\" / \"blocks\" for a class that represents a block in a neural network, typically a sequence of layers.\n",
    "  - \"backbone\" for a class that represents the main part of a neural network, typically a sequence of blocks.\n",
    "  - \"head\" for a class that represents the final part of a neural network, typically a single layer followed by an optional activation function.\n",
    "  - \"model\" for a class that represents a full neural network architecture.\n",
    "  - \"optimizer\" for a class that represents an optimizer.\n",
    "  - \"loss\" for a class that represents a loss function.\n",
    "  - \"metric\" for a class that represents a metric.\n",
    "- If there is a naming conflict within a class, add numbers to the end of the name with an underscore, 0-indexed. For example, `layer_0` and `layer_1`.\n",
    "  - This is correct: `layer_0`, `layer_1`, `layer_2`.\n",
    "  - This is incorrect: `layer_1`, `layer_2`, `layer_3`.\n",

    "All new features should be tested. The tests should cover all possible code paths and should be as comprehensive as possible. The tests should be written using the `unittest` module in Python. The tests should be placed in the `tests` folder. The tests should be run using `unittest`. Not all tests follow our guidelines yet, but we are working on improving them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we aim to mirror the structure of the `deeplay` package in the `tests` package. For example, `deeplay.external.layer` should have a corresponding `tests/external/test_layer.py` file. The name of the file should be the same as the module it tests, but with `test_` prepended. Note that when adding a folder, the `__init__.py` file should be added to the folder to make it a package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each test file should contain one `unittest.TestCase` class per class or method being tested. The test methods should be as descriptive as possible. For example, `test_forward` is not a good name for a test method. Instead, use `test_forward_with_valid_input` or `test_forward_with_invalid_input`. The test methods should be as independent as possible, but we value coverage over independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is fine to use multiple subtests using `with self.subTest()` to test multiple inputs or edge cases. This is particularly useful when testing a method that has many possible inputs.\n",
